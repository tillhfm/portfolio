# [tillhfm.de](https://tillhfm.de/) - Till Hoffmann - Portfolio  
This is my personal portfolio page built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). The project is inspired by and partially copied from Dillon Verma's [portfolio template](https://github.com/dillionverma/portfolio). The website is in German because it only aims to attract German visitors.

## Tech stack
### This project utilizes:
- **Next.js** - as the base framework
- **Tailwind CSS** - for easier styling
- **shadcn/ui** and **magicui** - for ready-to-use React components
- **momentjs** - for date calculations

## Data  
Since the portfolio is not built to be reusable, all data is stored within the project's `src` directory. This makes it super easy for me to run and deploy it anywhere, as it does not depend on external services.

## Contribution / Bugs  
Bug reports or fixes via PR are much appreciated. If you want to report something that's off on the site, just hit me up via one of the contact methods specified at the bottom of the page.
